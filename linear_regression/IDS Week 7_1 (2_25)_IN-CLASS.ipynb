    "In this demo, we:\n",
    "- Built and evaluated a linear regression model on unscaled data.\n",
    "- Re-trained the model after applying feature scaling.\n",
    "- Observed that while overall performance metrics (**MSE** and **R²**) may be similar, scaling is crucial for the interpretability of model coefficients and for ensuring that features contribute in a balanced way.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- **Coefficients:** On unscaled data, coefficients are tied to the original units, which can be hard to compare.\n",
    "  After scaling, coefficients represent the effect of a one standard deviation change in the feature.\n",
    "- **R² Score:** Reflects the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.\n",
    "- **MSE (and RMSE):** Lower values indicate better model performance; RMSE provides an error measure in the target's units.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process reflects the \"remember-formulate-predict\" approach in machine learning."
