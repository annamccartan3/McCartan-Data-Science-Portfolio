# :medal_sports: Gold Standard (project goals & highlight tidy data principles)
**Gold Standard** is a Jupyter Notebook for tidying and visualizing data from the **2008 Summer Olympics** in Beijing. This project applies [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) principles to enable effective analysis.

## Using the Script (step-by-step instructions)
#### Install & Import necessary dependencies
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
#### Download the data
- Download olympics08.csv and place it in the data folder within your project directory.
- Download the TidyData.ipynb Notebook file
#### Run the Notebook
 * Run the Notebook in your browser, Google Colab, VSCode, or another code editor compatible with the .ipynb format
   
## The Olympics Dataset (comprehensive & easy to follow dataset details)
The app uses a modified dataset about **2008 Olympic Medalists** adapted from the following [source](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2008/). The dataset contains information about 1875 different athletes and the corresponding medals earned in each of 75 different events.

## App Features
- Input the untidy dataset, then export the cleaned version (olympics08_cleaned.csv) directly into the data folder
- Visualize
- Test a range of aggregation functions that group the data by event, gender, medal type, or all of the above!
