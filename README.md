# :sunflower: Anna McCartan's Data Science Portfolio!

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**, a collection of projects from my Introduction to Data Science course (Spring 2025). This repository highlights my work in **data management and machine learning**, demonstrating my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as build interactive applications.

Each project includes a link to its repository, where you’ll find code, documentation, and instructions to view or replicate the analysis.

## Data Management
**Organizing, cleaning, and transforming data for analysis using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**  
### Projects
- :dog: [**DogFinder**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app)<br> 
  A **Streamlit** app that helps users explore **dog breed characteristics**, offering a user-friendly interface for filtering and searching breeds based on key traits. This project deepened my exposure to interactive data presentation, building a foundation with User Experience and accessible app development. [Launch DogFinder](https://dogfinder.streamlit.app) 
- :medal_sports: [**Gold Standard**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)<br>
  A **Jupyter Notebook** project that tidies and visualizes data from the **2008 Summer Olympics** in Beijing, applying [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) principles for effective analysis. This project underscores the importance of clean data in facilitating aggregation, visualization, and statistical modeling.
### Coursework
- [Handling Missing Data](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/handling_missing_data)<br>
  Techniques for detecting and addressing missing values.
- [Tidy Data](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/tidy_data)<br>
  Applying structured principles to ensure datasets are clean and well-formatted.
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/data_wrangling)<br>
  Methods for reshaping, merging, and structuring messy datasets to prepare them for further analysis.<br><br>

## Machine Learning  
**Leveraging statistical models in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to extract insights, analyze patterns, and make data-driven predictions.**
### Projects
- :robot: [**DataFlex**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)<br> 
A Streamlit app for exploring supervised machine learning through model selection, tuning, and evaluation. Users can upload datasets, preprocess features, and train models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors, with real-time performance metrics and visualizations to guide interpretation. This project builds on prior work in classification pipelines and model evaluation, extending it into an interactive, user-centered tool that emphasizes algorithmic transparency, hands-on experimentation, and deployment-ready workflows. [Launch DataFlex](https://dataflex.streamlit.app) 
- :bulb: [**DataQuest**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)<br> 
A Streamlit app for unsupervised machine learning that enables users to uncover hidden structures in data through clustering (K-Means, hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction (PCA). Interactive controls and dynamic plots support real-time exploration of grouping behavior, variance, and pattern discovery. As a complement to DataFlex, this project expands the portfolio into exploratory, label-free learning, highlighting the importance of structural insight and feature relationships in complex datasets. [Launch DataQuest](https://dataquest.streamlit.app)
