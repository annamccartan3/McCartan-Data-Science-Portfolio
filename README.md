# :sunflower: Anna McCartan's Data Science Portfolio!

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**, a collection of projects from my Introduction to Data Science course (Spring 2025). This repository highlights my work in **data management, app design, and machine learning**, demonstrating my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as build interactive applications.

Each project includes a link to its repository, where you’ll find code, documentation, and instructions to view or replicate the analysis.

## Data Management
**Organizing, cleaning, and transforming data for analysis using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**  
- [Handling Missing Data](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/handling_missing_data)<br>
  Techniques for detecting and addressing missing values.
- [Tidy Data](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/tidy_data)
  - :medal_sports: [**Gold Standard**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)<br>
    A Jupyter Notebook project that tidies and visualizes data from the **2008 Summer Olympics** in Beijing, applying [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) principles for effective analysis.
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/data_wrangling)<br>
  Methods for reshaping, merging, and structuring messy datasets to prepare them for further analysis.  
<br><br>
## App Design
**Building interactive applications with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to visualize and explore data**  
- :dog: [**DogFinder**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app)<br> 
  A **Streamlit** app that helps users explore **dog breed characteristics**, offering a user-friendly interface for filtering and searching breeds based on key traits.
<br><br>
## Machine Learning
**Applying statistical models in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to uncover insights and make predictions**  
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/linear_regression)<br>
  Implementing **linear regression models** to analyze relationships between variables, visualize trends, and make predictions.
