# :sunflower: Anna McCartan's Data Science Portfolio!

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**, a collection of projects from my Introduction to Data Science course (Spring 2025). This repository highlights my work in **data management and machine learning**, demonstrating my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as build interactive applications.

Each project includes a link to its repository, where you’ll find code, documentation, and instructions to view or replicate the analysis.

## Data Management
**Organizing, cleaning, and transforming data for analysis using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**  
### Projects
- :dog: [**DogFinder**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app)<br> 
  A **Streamlit** app that helps users explore **dog breed characteristics**, offering a user-friendly interface for filtering and searching breeds based on key traits. This project deepened my exposure to interactive data presentation, building a foundation with User Experience and accessible app development.
- :medal_sports: [**Gold Standard**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)<br>
  A Jupyter Notebook project that tidies and visualizes data from the **2008 Summer Olympics** in Beijing, applying [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) principles for effective analysis. This project underscores the importance of clean data in facilitating aggregation, visualization, and statistical modeling.
### Coursework
- [Handling Missing Data](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/handling_missing_data)<br>
  Techniques for detecting and addressing missing values.
- [Tidy Data](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/tidy_data)<br>
  Applying structured principles to ensure datasets are clean and well-formatted.
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/data_wrangling)<br>
  Methods for reshaping, merging, and structuring messy datasets to prepare them for further analysis.<br><br>

## Machine Learning  
**Leveraging statistical models in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to extract insights, analyze patterns, and make data-driven predictions.**
### Projects
- :robot: [**DataFlex**](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)<br> 
A **Streamlit** app that allows users to explore model selection, tuning, and evaluation. Real-time comparisons highlight the importance of algorithmic transparency, hyperparameter optimization, and diverse evaluation metrics. Building on earlier projects, this app introduces a dynamic interface for hands-on experimentation and model deployment.

### Coursework
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/linear_regression)  
  Developing **linear regression models** to quantify relationships between variables, visualize trends, and make continuous predictions.  
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/logistic_regression)  
  Applying **logistic regression** for classification tasks, analyzing categorical outcomes, and assessing data trends.  
- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/decision_trees)  
  Implementing **decision trees** to model complex decision-making processes, improve interpretability, and enhance predictive accuracy.  
- [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://github.com/annamccartan3/MCCARTAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/k_nearest_neighbors)  
  Utilizing **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for pattern recognition, clustering, and classification based on feature similarity.
