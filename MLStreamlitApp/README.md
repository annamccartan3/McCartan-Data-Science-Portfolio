# :robot: DataFlex
*An Interactive Machine Learning App*  

## Project Overview  
**DataFlex** is a [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/) app that applies supervised machine learning (ML) models to any dataset. You can use DataFlex to make predictions, adjust hyperparameters, and visualize model performance.

### Features
**Make predictions**: DataFlex is equipped for the following supervised machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)<br><br>
**Adjust hyperparameters**: Model-specific hyperparameter sliders allow you to balance model performance and simplicity
**Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess and compare various models through numerous evaluation metrics, including:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

### Run the App
Access the [**MLStreamlit**](https://mccartan-mlstreamlit-app.streamlit.app/) app on any device!

## Using the App

### Choose your Data  
Choose from 2 demo datasets to practice making predictions, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating models!
- **Demo Dataset 1: Titanic**: Explanation of dataset
- **Demo Dataset 2: Iris**: Explanation of dataset<br>

Or, use the 'input' tab to upload your own .csv file

### Data Refinement

### Train your Model

### Visualize Results
